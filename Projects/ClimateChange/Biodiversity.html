        <h5><b>Climate Change has a negitive impact with Biodiversity because...</b></h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>•	Biodiversity is failing because we force animals to move to cooler places like mountains or migrate north.<br> By making animals move to a different habitat, they will need to find a new food cycle or die of hunger.</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	If climate change continues and temperatures increase, Plants will also take a toll. Since plants do not have nerves,<br> they can’t move meaning that if climate change continues, plants will die.</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	If plants die, we will need to rethink our foods and plant-based food like grain and rice will be much more expensive.<br> If common food is going to go up, our economy will fall too. Think about it, without being able to buy Fruits, Vegetables and Grains,<br> our economy can turn dangerous.</p>

<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Context</h3>
<br>
<p>It was a normal day for Greece, everyone was doing their thing. Some people were learning in the school, some people were collecting Fruits and Vegetables to bring to their favorite gods, some people were building things to help warship the Gods. One of those people happened to be Young, Curious Armadillo. </p>
<br>
<p>Armadillo was a 5’7’’ man with a passion not yet discovered, Architecture. He was not a successful man though as he gave up easily and did not give enough effort to do anything right. So, once he went to the building that he was about to work on, he was already feeling heavy and lazy.</p>
<br>
<p>“Hello Boss!” he yelled as he got rid of all the positive energy he had left. Once his boss greeted him back, he was about to injure himself to go back home. After screaming viciously “Help! Help!” he later fainted and was met by the rather busy Architorious.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Meeting Architorious</h3>
<br>
<p>A muscular, blue eyed male god stud up to him and said with great anger, “Why did you injure yourself?” as he called the God of Health to heal the man. After Armadillo told him a complete lie, Architorious slammed the table and broke a little bit of the floor.</p>
<br>
<p>“How dare you? How could you have ever had the courage to upset a god?” he said while getting mad at the man. Armadillo’s face turned from a tanned brown to a pale white in a split second. Armadillo had 2 choices, tell the God of Architecture the truth or tell him another lie and hope that he believes it. He chose to tell him another lie.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Anger Arose</h3>
<br>
<p>As the Greek God tried to lie again. He made a story that he “was kidnapped” and that he “got stabbed until he fainted”. Anger rose when Architorious saw what happened. He slammed his desk so hard that the people below him heard and Armadillo fell near an edge a fire pit. He gave Armadillo one last chance to tell him what happened at the time he got injured. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">With no more options...</h3>
<br>
<p>The weak Armadillo was getting weaker by the second and thought in his head that it was the end for him, he will burn in a fire pit. Architorious asked the man one last time, this time he had to tell the truth. He had no other option, so he showed him his laziness and his bogus actions. He told him the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>He told him how he wanted to get injured to go back to his house. Architorious found this hard to believe but after a while he found out that his bravery of telling the awful truth about what have happened. He let him go back to his world with two conditions.</p>
<br>
<p>He had to tell his boss what he did, and he also needed to give effort on everything, no matter how small or stupid it is.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Back on Earth</h3>
<br>
<p>When Armadillo woke up, he was surrounded by people. His boss was in panic, and his co-workers were doing everything they can to revive Armadillo. After he woke up, he stood up and told the boss what happened.</p>
<br>
<p>He did not get paid for the job because of the panic he caused. But the next day when he went to work, he tried the hardest he ever did and then looked back at his work. He found his new passion, Architecture.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">20 years later</h3>
<br>
<p>We meet Armadillo again, with a scar in the lower leg from the injury provoked by young him. He was making his final project before he retires from his passion and rests. He was greeted once more by the strong and powerful Architorious.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Seeing Architorious</h3>
<br>
<p>Architorious was just like Armadillo described him 2 decades ago. Strong, Brave, and Creative. He looked up at old Armadillo and said words that Armadillo will remember for the rest of his life. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Architorious said... Again</h3>
<br>
<p>“Hello Again, Armadillo. How glad am I to see you again.” After Armadillo greeted the God once more, Architorious said “I’ve seen all the work that you have done and all the buildings your hands have built from the ground up”. Armadillo thanked him and was about to say how much he loved Architecture until the God interrupted him once more.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-text-blue">Armadillo is being promoted!</h3>
<br>
<p>Architorious said how he wanted more people on his team and how Armadillo was the person for the job. Armadillo did not know what to say! He was going to work with Architorious! He accepted the offer and before he started working, Architorious stopped him.</p>
<br>
<p>Armadillo had to promise to never go back to earth. He would have to stay with the gods and lose everything that he has built in earth. He thought about it and agreed to the condition. That same day, he started his first project. Architorious palace.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="w3-center">End</h3>
